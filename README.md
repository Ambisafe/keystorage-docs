# Keystorage Service

simple API to store and retrieve keys.

## Features

- open standard format used: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition
- no authentication, UUID v4 generated by client used as secret key
- rate-limiting used to prevent brute-force attacks

## Usage

persist newly generated key:
```
POST /api/v0/keystore/<uuid v4>

{
  "json": "according to secret storage definition",
  "storageToken": "token"
}
```
retrieve key:
```
GET /api/v0/keystore/<uuid v4>
```

## Billing integration

`storageToken` is used to charge tenant for operations. Following steps necessary:

1. validate that token valid
2. execute operation - create dataset
3. claim token as spent


## Security 

Rate-limiting used to prevent brute-force attacks on GET operation. Any IP that produced 3 x 404 should be banned for 10 minutes.
